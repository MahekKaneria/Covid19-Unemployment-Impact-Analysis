# COVID-19 and Unemployment Analysis

## Project Overview

This project aims to analyze the relationship between COVID-19 cases and unemployment rates, exploring how the pandemic has impacted employment in different regions. By leveraging data from various sources, this analysis seeks to identify correlations between the increase in COVID-19 cases and fluctuations in unemployment rates.

## Objectives

- To collect and clean datasets related to COVID-19 cases and unemployment rates.
- To perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to examine potential correlations between the two variables.
- To visualize the data through scatter plots and other relevant graphical representations.
- To draw conclusions about the relationship between COVID-19 cases and unemployment rates based on the analysis.

## Datasets

- **CovidCases.csv**: This dataset contains information about daily COVID-19 cases in various regions, including cumulative confirmed cases.
- **UnemploymentRate.csv**: This dataset provides information on monthly unemployment rates in the same regions, allowing for a comprehensive analysis of the economic impact of the pandemic.

## Files

- **analysis.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook file that contains the code for data cleaning, exploratory analysis, visualization, and conclusions drawn from the data.

## Dependencies

To run this project, the following dependencies are required:

- Python 3.1 or higher
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Findings and Conclusion

- The scatterplot analysis indicates a correlation between COVID-19 cases and unemployment rates, particularly during the initial phases of the pandemic.
- As COVID-19 cases rose, unemployment rates also increased, but trends began to shift as society adapted to remote work and new business opportunities emerged.
- The analysis suggests that while there is a correlation, it is important to consider other factors that may influence unemployment rates, such as the growth of online businesses and changing work dynamics.

## Future Work

Further analysis could involve:

- Investigating additional variables that might impact the relationship, such as government policies and economic support measures.
- Expanding the dataset to include more regions or longer timeframes for a more comprehensive understanding of the effects of COVID-19 on employment.
